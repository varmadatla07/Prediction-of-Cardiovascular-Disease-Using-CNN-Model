# Cholesterol Prediction System

## Overview
The Cholesterol Prediction System is a data-driven, non-invasive platform designed to predict cholesterol levels and assess cardiovascular risk. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system integrates socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical data to provide accurate and holistic predictions. This project is a multi-phase endeavor aimed at creating a scalable and efficient solution to support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
